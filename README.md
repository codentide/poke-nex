# Poke-Nex 🐾

A high-performance Pokédex built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

The main focus of this project is the implementation of Clean Architecture (Fetchers, Adapters, and Services layers) and the use of ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) to deliver an instant user experience and highly maintainable code.
